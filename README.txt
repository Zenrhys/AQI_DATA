For practical reasons these 3 scripts have been written to 
collect all air quality data recognized within the EPAs 3 main classes of substances (criteria gases, particulates, toxics) and organizes in a file structure that is easy to read.

Due to the sheer size of the resulting files it is unrealistic to store all the data in this repo.
If you seek to obtain the data, simply run these three scripts with your api-key and email inputted in the respective fields,
and simply wait for the progress bar to hit 100%. 
The scripts give detailed error messages in case there is an error during a request from the EPA API.
